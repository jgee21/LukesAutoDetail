# LukesAutoDetail
The code I have written for the website I created Lukesautodetail.com

Over the past 5-6 months I have committed myself to learning HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript so that I could create a website from scratch for my good friends auto detailing company. 
I am proud to say that several months later I have created a fully functioning website that is capable of many things!
